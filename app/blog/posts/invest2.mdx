## Update #1

This is an update two months after I started to invest.

I have around 7-8 different holdings in companies with a strong history of dividend growth and payouts. I have reached into companies such as Coca-Cola (KO) and Chevron (CVX).

My portfolio balance currently stands at around $1,100 USD. I put around $100 a week into the account, or $200 if I miss a week.

I have a lean towards ETFs with nearly half of my portfolio in SCHD and JEPQ. The others are spread out at around 10-15% of my portfolio

That's all for today, cheers!
