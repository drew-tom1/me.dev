## Update #2

This is an update three months after I started to invest.

I've been swamped with schoolwork and applying to internships this past month. I haven't had too much of a chance to work and put money into my account.

That being said, I have some good news from my portfolio! My portfolio has grown to $1,150 USD. My holdings have experienced a 6.22% increase in value over the last few months.

Chevron (CVX) and Palantir (PLTR) stand as my biggest gainers, with $33.73 gain on CVX and $25.69 on PLTR, which are 11.01% and 78.30% increases respectively.

That's all for this update. Hopefully internship application season slows down and I can add more to my portfolio.

Cheers!
