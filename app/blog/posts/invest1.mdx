## Learning about Investments!

I learned at a very young age that I wanted to be financially independent. I saw firsthand how having financial literacy and taking baby steps could go a long way to ensuring that I would never need to worry about making end's meet.

I bounced between financial influencers trying to soak up a little bit of information at a time. People like Humphrey Yang or Ryne Williams helped stress the importance of making my money work for me. The importance of things like a High Yield Savings Account (HYSA) or a brokerage account to start holding stocks that would appreciate in value were drilled into my head.

I started a Fidelity brokerage account so I could start buying stocks. I planned to invest at least $100 a week and start learning about ETFs and dividends.

So far, I only have two ETFs in my individual account and no individual company stocks. I bought shares of JEPQ and SCHD to start on the road to dividend investing.

That's all for this one, cheers!
